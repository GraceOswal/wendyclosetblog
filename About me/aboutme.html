				Currently 23 years old with a vision to pursue my studies, control my life and also making sure that i'm heading
				towards achieving my goals as a young independent lady.
				I live in Kasarani-Sunton with my younger cousin who is still in Highschool.
		<h2> Background Information </h2>
			<p> After finishing my 12th grade (form 4) with a grade of C+ (53 points), I stayed at home for a whole year waiting for fees to join 
				the University to pursue my dream course Information Technology (IT). 
				I enrolled myself to Don Bosco Training, for Computer Packages while staying at my cousins place in Ngong, Nairobi.
				I later on joined JKUAT main campus, Juja in 2016. Life was not that easy because I used to learn Mon-Fri and then head out to work form
				Friday in the evening doing Promotions in any available outlets just to survive while helping myself out with bills.
				I later on called of my studies in my second year due to lack of fees which affected me because most of the time I was thrown out of class
				during the exam period.
				I worked as a promoter and a sales agent for Zuku and Safaricom just to get by. 

				Moringa School has rescued me and I always sleep late and wake up very early in the morning to practice my codes so that one day i'll make
				a glorious testimony about the scholarship they offered me when I thought my hopes were dead.
